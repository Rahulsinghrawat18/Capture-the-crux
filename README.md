## Important Points
1. You do not need to connect a wallet to play but connecting wallet allows you to select the skins. If both players have their wallet connected, they can agree to register the winner.
2. Zoom in/out if unable to see all pieces and map according to your comfort.
3. Read the How-to-play on Home page to know about the instructions.
4. For the online site, it may happen that the server does not respond due to being inactive after a period of inactivity as it was hosted on a free tier.

## Creating and Joining Room
A player can create room and get the room code which can then be shared with the other player, and both can jump into a game.


## Connect Wallet and Skins
A player can choose to connect their wallet. The code is set up to connect to MONAD Testnet since the contract was deployed on that. Although it is also set to ask permission to add the testnet if not present in user's metamask, if facing issue, make sure to add and switch to MONAD testnet before connecting wallet. Else if connected wallet but not on MONAD Testnet, you will be able to see current skins and the ones for collab but will be unable to buy the skins through smart contract.

### Current Skins
Shows the current equipped skins of the player. Go to lobby, reload page, and come back if you want to change to default skins after changing the skins.


### Available Skins 
Shows the current available skins you can buy and apply.


### MONAD Collab Skins
Shows the skins that are provided through some web3 collaboration. Right now there is a volcano map which you can buy and upon selecting that you can change your lobby and arena background.


## Registering the Winner
If both players have their wallet connected, then after one player wins, players can choose to agree and register the winning of the winner on blockchain. The option is provided on the same screen which shows who won after the game ends.

## GMONAD Tokens as Reward
The person who wins gets 100 GMONAD tokens as reward which he can see in his wallet upon successfully importing the GMONAD token address.
